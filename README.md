## Fisher's Iris data set, backgroud

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936 as an example of linear discriminant analysis. 

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.


## The Project
This project will investigate the Fisher's Iris data set and performs analysis using a python script

The code will output:
1. A summary of each variable to a single text file 
2. Histogram of each variable saved to png files
3. Scatter plot of each pair of variables
4. Performs other appropriate analysis

## Research
A CSV file of the Iris data set was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning repository

Data set contains 150 records under 5 atributes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal width and Species

Various analisys were performed and developed in order to distinquish between species
